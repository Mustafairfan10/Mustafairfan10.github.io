## 🧠 About Me

I’m a passionate full-stack developer with practical experience in building robust systems using the **MERN stack**, **Python**, and **SQL databases**. I love solving real-world problems with technology—be it automating hotel reception using voice bots, optimizing class schedules with AI, or building real-time cricket dashboards.

Currently exploring the intersection of AI and backend development, I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy bringing ideas to life from scratch.
